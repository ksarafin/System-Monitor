# CS252 Project 6

## Team Members:
Katherine Sarafin  
Sreeya Yekollu  
Elise Kwan  

## Instructions:
The Makefile included will generate an executable titled 'system_monitor'. 
Run the Makefile and execute 'system_monitor' to view and grade our project.

## Technologies:
Our project was organized and updated using a private repository on GitHub. 
We used the C language and employed GTK to write our GUI. The layout of our files is as follows:  

* system_monitor.c contains the majority of the code to develop and run the GUI. It calls on functions 
from other files to generate the information needed for the GUI.  

* system_info.c generates information pertaining to section 1.1 in the handout. 

* process_table.c generates information pertaining to section 1.2 in the handout. 

* // statistics.c?

* file_system_table generates information pertaining to section 1.4 in the handout. 

* All .h files are header files with function and variable declarations for clarity.
